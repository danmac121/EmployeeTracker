# EmployeeTracker

## Description 

This employee tracking app allows the user to view and update their database of employees. The user has options to view all departments, roles and employees, add or delete departments, roles and employees, update employee roles and managers, view employees by manager or department, as well as view the budget of any department. The application is run in the user's terminal and can be started by running node server.mjs. The employee tracker uses mysql2 to update the database and inquirer to prompt the user for their inputs. The schema uses foreign keys to reference different tables in the database and link the tables together. 

## Installation 

Clone down the repo, run npm i inquirer, npm i express, and npm install --save mysql2 in the command line. Then run node server.mjs to start the application.
